      <h1>WASH AND DRY</h1>
      <p>
        Just like the normal laundry process at home, we wash and dry clothes
        using laundry machine and hold them afterwards. If your items are
        delicate, we have a hand wash service. We accept clothes like delicate
        lingerie, wool sweaters, and silk sweaters that need gentle care, and
        clothes with tough stains that you cannot easily be removed.

      <h1>DRY CLEANING</h1>
      <p>
        Dry cleaning is a method of cleaning clothes and textiles without using
        water. Instead, a solvent is used to remove dirt, stains, and odors from
        the fabric. The most common solvent used in dry cleaning is
        perchloroethylene (perc), which is a colorless, nonflammable, and
        petroleum-based liquid.

      <h1>Leather Cleaning</h1>
      <p>
        Leather cleaning in laundry involves the process of removing dirt,
        grime, and other impurities from leather clothing and accessories.
        Leather is a delicate material that requires special care and attention
        to maintain its quality and appearance. The cleaning method used for
        leather depends on the type of leather, the level of soiling, and the
        specific product being cleaned.

      <h1>Ironing Service</h1>
      <p>
        Ironing is a method of pressing clothes to remove wrinkles and restore
        their original shape and appearance. The process involves heating an
        iron to a high temperature and then pressing it onto the fabric. The
        heat and pressure from the iron help to smooth out the fibers, making
        the fabric look neater and more presentable.
